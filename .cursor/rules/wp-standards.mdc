# WordPress & PHP Standards

- Follow WordPress PHP Coding Standards and best practices.
- Prefer OOP when appropriate; design for modularity and reuse.
- Prefer iteration/modularization over duplication.
- Use descriptive function, variable, and file names.
- Use lowercase-with-hyphens for directories (e.g., `wp-content/themes/my-theme`).
- Favor hooks (actions/filters) for extending functionality instead of modifying core.
- Use PHP 7.4+ features when appropriate (typed properties, arrow functions).
- Use `declare(strict_types=1);` where safe (be mindful of WordPress compatibility).
- Follow standard WordPress theme/plugin directory structures and naming conventions.
