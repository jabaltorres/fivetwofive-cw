# Security, Validation, Data

- Always validate and sanitize input using WordPress helpers (`sanitize_text_field`, `esc_url_raw`, etc.).
- Escape on output (`esc_html`, `esc_attr`, `esc_url`, etc.).
- Use nonces for all state-changing actions and form submissions.
- Use `$wpdb->prepare()` for SQL; never interpolate variables directly.
- Prefer the REST API or `admin-ajax.php` for AJAX; enforce capability checks.
- Use options API for configuration; prefer `register_setting()` for typed/validated options.
- Use transients API for lightweight caching; define sensible expirations.
- Log expected exceptions; handle with `try/catch` when needed and use WPâ€™s debug logging.
